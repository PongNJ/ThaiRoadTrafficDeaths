The data system is a key driver in promoting national road accident prevention efforts and advancing various operational strategies. Developing good plans and projects requires data that provides insight into the trends and severity of the problem, allowing for the identification of the causes and factors contributing to road accidents. This leads to concrete solutions. However, the current data comes from multiple agencies, each collecting data for different purposes. As a result, the information on the number of injured and deceased varies, and no single agency has comprehensive or complete data. Therefore, an integration of death data from three sources was conducted, including death certificates and official death records (a system registering all reported deaths), POLIS (a system recording criminal cases), and the E-Claim system (a system recording claims for compensation, primarily for motorcycle accidents), to obtain the most comprehensive death data possible.

Due to these issues, Thailand's data is often seen as unreliable. The Road Safety Directing Center recognized the importance of this and appointed a subcommittee on data management, monitoring, and evaluation, chaired by Dr. Nopparat Chuenklin, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Disease Control, with the Bureau of Non-Communicable Diseases serving as the secretariat. Additionally, based on the Cabinet resolution on September 29, 2010, the Ministry of Public Health was assigned the leading role in coordinating with relevant agencies to improve the collection and statistics of road accidents to make them systematic, accurate, and unified. This aims to ensure that the data can be effectively used for policy development, planning, and creating good measures, as well as for monitoring, evaluation, and key performance indicators in the Decade of Action for Road Safety. This data will also support the push for policies.

As per the subcommittee's resolution, road accident death data is to be integrated from three sources (health, police, and the Central Company), leading to the establishment of two working groups: the System Design group and the Output Design group. The work began in 2013 and has been ongoing, with several changes in responsibility among the involved agencies over three years. The operations have now succeeded, and the resulting data will be presented as the baseline for the Decade of Action for Road Safety, providing an overall picture of national efforts moving forward.
